                    <p>In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML 1.0. This was later released in 1993, although few developers were creating websites at the time.</p>
                    <p>By 1995, HTML 2.0 was published, expanding on the features of HTML, which would be the industry standard until HTML 3.0 was invented in 1997. Although the new features introduced by Dave Ragget allowed HTML to have more powerful tools for website design, the features would prove to slow down the browser in implementation</p>
                    <p>In 1999, HTML 4.0 was released, which was successful and stayed as the standard for website for over a decade. By 2014, HTML 5.0 was released and is now the modern standard for websites.</p>
