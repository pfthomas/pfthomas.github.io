                <h2>Focusing on HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML is not a programming language, rather, it is a markup language. This is a tool used to define the structure of a web page. It is the fundamental building block of modern web pages. The syntax and concept is described as a "plaintex document structured with elements. Elements are surrounded by matching opoening and closing tags. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (<>)" (HTML - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-Related Terms | MDN, n.d.). HTML makes use of hyperlinks and anchors to connect different pages to one another. Hyperlinks are the blue links on text or graphics on a site that can be spiecified in the language in order to connect the user to different parts of the site. These different link connections are the anchors that allow a user to navigate across a website and across multiple domains. </p>
                <p>It is not case sensetive, although typically HTML will be written in lowercase. It can be used in conjunction with javascript to creative interactive web pages, and when combined with CSS it allows developers to create visually pleasing and complex websites that can serve a variety of purposes for the user. HTML has the power to nest elements inside of itself, and ids and classes can be attributed to various JavaScript and CSS alterations to decorate and create functionality within the webpage.  </p>
                <p>It has has been managed by the World Wide Web Consortium since 1996, but the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group become the only publisher of HTML during 2019. This group is a community of people composed of developers from Apple, Mozilla, and Opera. Their focus is on implementing standards in web browsers, and their associated tests.</p>
